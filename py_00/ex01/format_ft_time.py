#time.asctime()
Convert a tuple or struct_time representing a time as returned by gmtime() or localtime() to a string of the following form: 
'Sun Jun 20 23:21:05 1993'. 
The day field is two characters long and is space padded if the day is a single digit, e.g.: 'Wed Jun  9 04:26:40 1993'.

If t is not provided, the current time as returned by localtime() is used. Locale information is not used by asctime().

today = time.asctime()
print(today)
asctime() is a fixed-format shortcut for one specific human-readable style, 
strftime() is the tool whenever format matters.

a = f"Seconds since January 1, 1970: {now:,.4f} or {now:.2e} in scientific notation"
print(a)
print(time.strftime("%b %d %Y"))
